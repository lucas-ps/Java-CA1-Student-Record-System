# OOP CA1 - UoK student record system
Java Continuous Assessment 1 Univerity of Exeter - University of Knowledge student record system

My first Java Continuous assessment, a basic object oriented student record system. The assessment brief described a student record system for a theoretical University called the university of Knowledge. Objects have been hard-coded in in the University class. 

## Main functions

- public int getTotalNumberStudents(): return the number of students registered in the system.
- public Student getBestStudent(): return the student with the highest GPA.
- public Module getBestModule(): return the module with the highest average score.
- public String printTranscript(): returns a formatted student transcript

## Usage

Testing of the functions has been commented out for marking however the program's functions can be tested by un-commenting the testing section at the end of the University class. Objects have been hard-coded in the University class.
